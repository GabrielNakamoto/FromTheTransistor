Lets use:

	5mhz 	= 5 million cycles a second
			-> 	increments timer by 5 million a second

	Period 	= 1 / 5,000,000 =  1 / 5 * 10^6
			= 5 * 10^-6

Period: How long does a cycle take
Hz:		How many cyles happen a second

mhz = 1 million cycles a second

therefore to find how long a period of a clock with n mhz
is you do 1 / n * 1,000,000


-> the greater the mhz, the shorter the period


ex. CLOCK_PERIOD = 10, 10ns period = 100mhz
